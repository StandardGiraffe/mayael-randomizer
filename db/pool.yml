    text: If Exquisite Archangel is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you’re
      dealt damage that brings your life total to 0 or less, its effect applies and
      your life total becomes equal to your starting life total. You choose whether
      Exquisite Archangel is moved to exile or to your graveyard.

    text: Exquisite Archangel’s effect applies any time you would lose the game, even
      if you’re not losing due to your life total being 0 or less. If you would have
      lost the game because you tried to draw from an empty library, you won’t lose
      again until you try to draw again and still can’t do so.

  - date: 2/9/2017
    text: For your life total to become your starting life total (normally 20), you
      gain or lose the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total
      is -4 when Exquisite Archangel’s ability applies, it will cause you to gain
      24 life; alternatively, if your life total is 40 when it applies, it will cause
      you to lose 20 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will
      interact with this effect accordingly.

    text: If an effect states that an opponent wins the game, Exquisite Archangel’s
      ability doesn’t apply.

    text: In a Two-Headed Giant game, Exquisite Archangel’s ability causes the team’s
      life total to become the team’s starting life total (normally 30), but only
      you actually gain or lose life.

      that says “Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}.”
  - date: 2/9/2017
    text: If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating
      that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact
      being tapped when you pay the spell’s costs. You won’t be able to tap it again
      for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability
      while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won’t be on the battlefield
      when you pay the spell’s costs, so you won’t be able to tap it for improvise.

    text: Although this ability triggers when the Incarnation is put into a graveyard

      lost this ability when it was put into the graveyard (due to Yixlid Jailer,

      in the graveyard.

      but before it resolves, it will remain in its new zone when its owner shuffles

      a different zone instead of being put into the graveyard, the ability won’t

    text: Panglacial Wurm’s ability works only while you’re searching your own library.
      The effect that caused you to search needs to say “search” and “library,” and
      you need to be looking through your own library for this to work. Examples of
      effects that let you cast Panglacial Wurm are Rampant Growth and Gifts Ungiven.
      Examples of effects that don’t are Bribery and Sage Owl.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: Casting Panglacial Wurm while searching your library follows all the normal
      rules for casting a creature spell, except for timing (casting the Wurm this
      way always occurs during the resolution of another spell or ability) and what
      zone the Wurm is being cast from. The spell goes on the stack. You have to pay
      the Wurm’s mana cost and any applicable additional costs, which means you can
      activate mana abilities while you’re casting the Wurm while you’re searching
      your library.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: After you cast Panglacial Wurm, you pick up the search effect where you
      left off. When the search effect finishes resolving, the active player gets
      priority with Panglacial Wurm on the stack. Any abilities that triggered when
      the spell was cast are put on the stack now.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: If you have enough mana, you can cast multiple Panglacial Wurms during a
      single search effect.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: A Panglacial Wurm that you cast while searching your library can’t be found
      by the search effect.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: If you want to cast Panglacial Wurm while searching your library, you must
      do so before you find any cards with the search effect.
  - date: 7/15/2006
    text: While searching your library, you must keep your library in the same order
      until you shuffle it. This order could matter if you tap Millikin for mana,
      for example, to pay for a Panglacial Wurm you cast from your library.

      Deep-Fiend’s converted mana cost remains 8.
  - date: 7/13/2016

      the time that you activate mana abilities. Its abilities may affect the spell’s
      cost, be activated to generate mana, and so on. However, if it has an ability
      that triggers when a spell is cast, it will have been sacrificed before that

      the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers
      on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same.
      The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means
      that in a two-player game, the nonactive player’s persist creatures will return
      to the battlefield first, then the active player’s persist creatures do the
      same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.

      the card won’t return to the battlefield. That’s because persist checks the
      creature’s existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has
      all those counters on it at that point.

      this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.

    text: There are no cards in the Fate Reforged set that would turn a face-down
      instant or sorcery card on the battlefield face up, but some older cards can
      try to do this. If something tries to turn a face-down instant or sorcery card
      on the battlefield face up, reveal that card to show all players it’s an instant
      or sorcery card. The permanent remains on the battlefield face down. Abilities
      that trigger when a permanent turns face up won’t trigger, because even though
      you revealed the card, it never turned face up.

    text: Some older Magic sets feature double-faced cards, which have a Magic card
      face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card
      back on the other. The rules for double-faced cards are changing slightly to
      account for the possibility that they are manifested. If a double-faced card
      is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down. While face down,
      it can’t transform. If the front face of the card is a creature card, you can
      turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up.
      A double-faced permanent on the battlefield still can’t be turned face down.

    text: When comparing the stats of the two creatures for evolve, you always compare
      power to power and toughness to toughness.
  - date: 4/15/2013
    text: Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, check its
      power and toughness against the power and toughness of the creature with evolve.
      If neither stat of the new creature is greater, evolve won’t trigger at all.
  - date: 4/15/2013
    text: If evolve triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability
      tries to resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability
      will do nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield
      before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to compare
      the stats.
  - date: 4/15/2013
    text: If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, consider
      those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For example, a 1/1 creature
      that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it will cause the evolve
      ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger.
  - date: 4/15/2013
    text: If multiple creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may
      trigger multiple times, although the stat comparison will take place each time
      one of those abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature
      with evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger
      twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature
      with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor
      the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with
      evolve, so that ability does nothing.
  - date: 4/15/2013
    text: When comparing the stats as the evolve ability resolves, it’s possible that
      the stat that’s greater changes from power to toughness or vice versa. If this
      happens, the ability will still resolve and you’ll put a +1/+1 counter on the
      creature with evolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve
      and a 1/3 creature enters the battlefield under your control, it toughness is
      greater so evolve will trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When
      the evolve trigger tries to resolve, its power is greater. You’ll put a +1/+1
      counter on the creature with evolve.

    text: Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying {3}, and lets you turn the
      face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
  - date: 9/20/2014
    text: The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0.
      When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player
      knows what it is, and pay {3}. This is an alternative cost.
  - date: 9/20/2014
    text: When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with
      no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It’s colorless and has a converted
      mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it
      any of these characteristics.
  - date: 9/20/2014
    text: Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up
      by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special
      action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to. Only a face-down
      permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
  - date: 9/20/2014
    text: Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it’s turned
      face up, turning a permanent face up doesn’t cause any enters-the-battlefield

    text: A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but
      is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that

    text: You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be

      they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this
      include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.
  - date: 9/20/2014
    text: If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You
      must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave

    text: If the targeted player is an illegal target by the time the ability resolves,
      the entire ability doesn’t resolve. No damage will be prevented.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: Vengeful Archon’s ability doesn’t have you choose a source of damage. It
      will apply to the next X damage you would be dealt that turn, regardless of
      where that damage comes from. It doesn’t matter whether the damage would all
      be dealt at the same time. For example, if X is 4 and you’d be dealt 3 damage
      by Lightning Bolt, that 3 damage is prevented and Vengeful Archon deals 3 damage
      to the targeted player. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 1
      damage you’d be dealt that turn.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: The effect of Vengeful Archon’s ability is not a redirection effect. If
      it prevents damage, Vengeful Archon (not the source of that damage) deals damage
      to the targeted player as part of that prevention effect. Vengeful Archon is
      the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source
      (such as its color, or whether it had lifelink or deathtouch) don’t affect this
      damage. The new damage is not combat damage, even if the prevented damage was.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: Whether the targeted player is still a legal target is no longer checked
      after Vengeful Archon’s ability resolves. For example, if a player targeted
      by Vengeful Archon’s ability puts Leyline of Sanctity (which says “You can’t
      be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control”) onto the battlefield
      after the ability resolves but before it prevents damage, the ability will still
      prevent damage and still deal damage to that player. If Vengeful Archon can’t
      deal damage to the targeted player (because the player is no longer in the game
      in a multiplayer game, for example), it will still prevent damage. It just won’t
      deal any damage itself.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: If Vengeful Archon’s ability doesn’t prevent any damage (perhaps because
      a different prevention effect is applied to the damage that would be dealt to
      you, or because the damage is unpreventable), Vengeful Archon won’t deal any
      damage itself.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: If Vengeful Archon’s ability prevents damage, Vengeful Archon deals its
      damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens
      before state-based actions are checked, and before any player can cast spells
      or activate abilities. If a spell or ability would have caused that damage to
      be dealt, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: If you would be dealt combat damage by multiple attacking creatures, you
      choose which of that damage to prevent. For example, if X is 3 and you’d be
      dealt combat damage by a 1/3 Scroll Thief and a 3/5 Siege Mastodon, you might
      choose to prevent 1 damage from the Scroll Thief and 2 damage from the Siege
      Mastodon. You don’t decide until the point at which the creatures would deal
      their damage.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: If the amount of damage that would be dealt to you is in excess of the amount
      of damage that Vengeful Archon’s ability would prevent, that source deals its
      excess damage to you at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then
      Vengeful Archon deals its damage.
  - date: 8/15/2010
    text: If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player who would
      be dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, say you’ve
      activated Vengeful Archon’s ability with X = 3 targeting Player A, and you’ve
      activated Vengeful Archon’s ability with X = 1 targeting Player B. You’re dealt
      2 damage. You can apply the first prevention effect (dealing 2 damage to Player
      A), or you can apply the second prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player
      B) followed by the first prevention effect (dealing 1 damage to Player A). The
      unused portions of the prevention effects remain.

      the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of their persist triggers
      on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same.
      The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means
      that in a two-player game, the nonactive player’s persist creatures will return
      to the battlefield first, then the active player’s persist creatures do the
      same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.

      the card won’t return to the battlefield. That’s because persist checks the
      creature’s existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has
      all those counters on it at that point.

    text: Several cards have a cost reduction based on the number of creatures in
      your party. To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost
      or alternative cost you’re paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost
      reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell is determined only by its mana
      cost, no matter what the total cost to cast the spell was.

    text: To determine “the number of creatures in your party,” check whether you
      control a Cleric, whether you control a Rogue, whether you control a Warrior,
      and whether you control a Wizard. The number is the total number of those checks
      to which you answered yes. Each creature you control can be counted for only
      one of those checks.
  - date: 9/25/2020
    text: If a creature has more than one party creature type, and there are multiple
      ways to count that creature that could result in a different number of creatures
      in your party, the highest such number is used. For example, if you control
      a Cleric and a Cleric Wizard, the number of creatures in your party is two.
      You can’t choose to have it be just one by counting the Cleric Wizard first
      as a Cleric.
